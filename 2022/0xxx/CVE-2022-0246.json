An authorized user can import preconfigured settings of the plugin by uploading a zip file. After the uploading process, files in the uploaded zip file are extracted one by one. During the extraction process, existence of a file is checked. If the file exists, it is deleted without any security control by only considering the name of the extracted file. This behavior leads to \"Zip Slip\" vulnerability."
