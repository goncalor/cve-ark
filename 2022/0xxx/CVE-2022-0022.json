					"value": "Usage of a weak cryptographic algorithm in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software where the password hashes of administrator and local user accounts are not created with a sufficient level of computational effort, which allows for password cracking attacks on accounts in normal (non-FIPS-CC) operational mode.\n\nAn attacker must have access to the account password hashes to take advantage of this weakness and can acquire those hashes if they are able to gain access to the PAN-OS software configuration.\n\nFixed versions of PAN-OS software use a secure cryptographic algorithm for account password hashes.\n\nThis issue does not impact Prisma Access firewalls.\n\nThis issue impacts:\nPAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.21;\nAll versions of PAN-OS 9.0;\nPAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.11;\nPAN-OS 10.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.0.7."
