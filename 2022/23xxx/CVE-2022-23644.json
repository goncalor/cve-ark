The functionality to load a cover via url is vulnerable to a server-side request forgery attack. Any BookWyrm instance running a version prior to v0.3.0 is susceptible to attack from a logged-in user. The problem has been patched and administrators should upgrade to version 0.3.0 As a workaround, BookWyrm instances can close registration and limit members to trusted individuals."
