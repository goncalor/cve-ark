					"value": "A vulnerability in the RADIUS feature of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the affected system to stop processing RADIUS packets. This vulnerability is due to improper handling of certain RADIUS requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to authenticate to a network or a service where the access server is using Cisco ISE as the RADIUS server. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause Cisco ISE to stop processing RADIUS requests, causing authentication/authorization timeouts, which would then result in legitimate requests being denied access. Note: To recover the ability to process RADIUS packets, a manual restart of the affected Policy Service Node (PSN) is required. See the Details section for more information."
