This vulnerability exists because administrative privilege levels for sensitive data are not properly enforced. An attacker with read-only privileges for the web-based management interface on an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by browsing to a page that contains sensitive data. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to collect sensitive information about the system configuration."
