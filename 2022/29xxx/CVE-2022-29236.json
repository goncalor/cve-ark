Starting in version 2.2 and up to versions 2.3.18 and 2.4-rc-6, an attacker can circumvent access restrictions for drawing on the whiteboard. The permission check is inadvertently skipped on the server, due to a previously introduced grace period. The attacker must be a meeting participant. The problem has been patched in versions 2.3.18 and 2.4-rc-6. There are currently no known workarounds."
