Prior to version 10.5.9, the user controlled twig templates rendering in `Pimcore/Mail` & `ClassDefinition\\Layout\\Text` is vulnerable to server-side template injection, which could lead to remote code execution. Version 10.5.9 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, one may apply the patch manually."
