					"value": "The web console for Mimosa B5, B5c, and C5x firmware through 2.8.0.2 allows authenticated command injection in the Throughput, WANStats, PhyStats, and QosStats API classes. An attacker with access to a web console account may execute operating system commands on affected devices by sending crafted POST requests to the affected endpoints (/core/api/calls/Throughput.php, /core/api/calls/WANStats.php, /core/api/calls/PhyStats.php, /core/api/calls/QosStats.php). This results in the complete takeover of the vulnerable device. This vulnerability does not occur in the older 1.5.x firmware versions."
