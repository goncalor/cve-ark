					"value": "Garmin Forerunner 235 before 8.20 is affected by: Array index error. The component is: ConnectIQ TVM. The attack vector is: To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must upload a malicious ConnectIQ application to the ConnectIQ store. The ConnectIQ program interpreter trusts the offset provided for the stack value duplication instruction, DUP. The offset is unchecked and memory prior to the start of the execution stack can be read and treated as a TVM object. A successful exploit could use the vulnerability to leak runtime information such as the heap handle or pointer for a number of TVM context variables. Some reachable values may be controlled enough to forge a TVM object on the stack, leading to possible remote code execution."
