					"value": "A vulnerability in the video endpoint API (xAPI) of Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software, Cisco TelePresence Codec (TC) Software, and Cisco RoomOS Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct directory traversal attacks on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the xAPI of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the xAPI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read and write arbitrary files in the system. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need either an In-Room Control or administrator account."
