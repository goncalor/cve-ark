					"value": "Re:Desk 2.3 has a blind authenticated SQL injection vulnerability in the SettingsController class, in the actionEmailTemplates() method. A malicious actor with access to an administrative account could abuse this vulnerability to recover sensitive data from the application's database, allowing for authorization bypass and taking over additional accounts by means of modifying password-reset tokens stored in the database. Remote command execution is also possible by leveraging this to abuse the Yii framework's bizRule functionality, allowing for arbitrary PHP code to be executed by the application. Remote command execution is also possible by using this together with a separate insecure file upload vulnerability (CVE-2020-15488)."
