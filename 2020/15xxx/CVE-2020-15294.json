					"value": "Compiler Optimization Removal or Modification of Security-critical Code vulnerability in IntPeParseUnwindData() results in multiple dereferences to the same pointer. If the pointer is located in memory-mapped from the guest space, this may cause a race-condition where the generated code would dereference the same address twice, thus obtaining different values, which may lead to arbitrary code execution. This issue affects: Bitdefender Hypervisor Introspection versions prior to 1.132.2."
