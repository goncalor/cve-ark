AttachmentUploadServlet deserializes untrusted data from the `Attachment-Support` header. This Servlet does not enforce any authentication or authorization checks. This issue may lead to pre-auth remote code execution. This issue was fixed in 4.0.3 by removing AttachmentUploadServlet and not using deserialization"
