Furthermore, the plugin is also lacking any CSRF check, allowing such issue to be exploited via a CSRF attack as well. However, due to the presence of a .htaccess, denying access to everything in the folder the file is uploaded to, the malicious uploaded file will only be accessible on Web Servers such as Nginx/IIS"
