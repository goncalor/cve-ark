					"value": "A vulnerability in the authentication for the general purpose APIs implementation of Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA), Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA), and Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access general system information and certain configuration information from an affected device. The vulnerability exists because a secure authentication token is not required when authenticating to the general purpose API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request for information to the general purpose API on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain system and configuration information from the affected device, resulting in an unauthorized information disclosure."
