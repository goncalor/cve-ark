					"value": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. A malicious user could trigger a division by 0 in `Conv3D` implementation. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/42033603003965bffac51ae171b51801565e002d/tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_ops_3d.cc#L143-L145) does a modulo operation based on user controlled input. Thus, when `filter` has a 0 as the fifth element, this results in a division by 0. Additionally, if the shape of the two tensors is not valid, an Eigen assertion can be triggered, resulting in a program crash. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
