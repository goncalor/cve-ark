This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input that is processed by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by adding malicious code to the configuration by using the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information."
