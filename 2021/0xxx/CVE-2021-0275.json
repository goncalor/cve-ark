					"value": "A Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in J-Web on Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to target another user's session thereby gaining access to the users session. The other user session must be active for the attack to succeed. Once successful, the attacker has the same privileges as the user. If the user has root privileges, the attacker may be able to gain full control of the device. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS: 12.3 versions prior to 12.3R12-S15 on EX Series; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D95 on SRX Series; 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S6 on EX Series; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D200 on SRX Series; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R7-S7; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R2-S11, 16.2R3; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R2-S11, 17.1R3-S2; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R3-S3; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R2-S5, 17.3R3-S7; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S9, 17.4R3; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S9; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2-S7, 18.2R3-S3; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R1-S7, 18.3R2-S3, 18.3R3-S1; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S6, 18.4R2-S4, 18.4R3; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S1, 19.1R3; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S3, 19.2R2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2."
