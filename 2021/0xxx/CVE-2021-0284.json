					"value": "A buffer overflow vulnerability in the TCP/IP stack of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to send specific sequences of packets to the device thereby causing a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nBy repeatedly sending these sequences of packets to the device, an attacker can sustain the Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\nThe device will abnormally shut down as a result of these sent packets.  A potential indicator of compromise will be the following message in the log files:\n  \"eventd[13955]: SYSTEM_ABNORMAL_SHUTDOWN: System abnormally shut down\"\n\nThis issue is only triggered by traffic destined to the device.  Transit traffic will not trigger this issue.\nThis issue affects:\nJuniper Networks Junos OS\n12.3 versions prior to 12.3R12-S19;\n15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S10;\n17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S12;\n18.4 versions prior to 18.4R3-S9;\n19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S7;\n19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S7, 19.2R3-S3;\n19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S3;\n19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S5;\n20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-S1;\n20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S2;\n20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S1;\n20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-S2, 20.4R3;\n21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2;\n21.2 versions prior to 21.2R2."
