					"lang": "en",
					"value": "in-toto-golang is a go implementation of the in-toto framework to protect software supply chain integrity. In affected versions authenticated attackers posing as functionaries (i.e., within a trusted set of users for a layout) are able to create attestations that may bypass DISALLOW rules in the same layout. An attacker with access to trusted private keys, may issue an attestation that contains a disallowed artifact by including path traversal semantics (e.g., foo vs dir/../foo). Exploiting this vulnerability is dependent on the specific policy applied. The problem has been fixed in version 0.3.0."
