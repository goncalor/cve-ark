This occurs when:\n - Self user is added to a new conversation\n - Self user is added to an existing conversation\n - All the participants in the conversation were previously marked as verified.\nThe vulnerability is patched in wire-ios version 3.8.1. As a workaround, one can unverify & verify a device in the conversation."
