Before version 3.21.0, when uploading a file, the local file preview can lead to execution of scripts embedded in the uploaded file. This can only occur after several user interactions to open the preview in a separate tab. This only impacts the local user while in the process of uploading. It cannot be exploited remotely or by other users. This vulnerability is patched in version 3.21.0."
